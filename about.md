### About our website
This website has been founded and created to help users picking their servers to join the federated network of Matrix. These servers are monitored for uptime and public data from the servers them selves. While joining any of these servers hold no guarantee for maintenance of the running software or uptime our aim is to provide the most accurate listings of Matrix home servers. Each maintainer that have their server listed on our website have agreed actively or silently that the server is being actively maintained.

### Curated public matrix server listing
Our server list is curated on basis of the official matrix.org [code of conduct](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/code_of_conduct.html) and reliability of the maintainer. We process our servers through the basis of current _existing_ information that we know from the _present_ and the _past_ events. Meaning that some servers won't make it through our moderation and will be rejected for our server listing. We tend to aim for the best available servers that is safe to join and reliable for uptime and maintenance of synapse.

### Moderation of matrix servers
Moderation is done through collaboration with [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) and the matrix united community that are volunteering to help out. The intention of collaboration is to be able to safely process server listings and information in the shape of a [council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council). That will guide and be a failsafe for our website [matrixservers.net](https://matrixservers.net) for each server listing on our website. This includes server listings, moderation, and chatroom operation at [#matrixservers:novaim.com](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com).

#### Listing Requirements:
+ The server must follow the [code of conduct](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/code_of_conduct.html) by matrix.org
+ The server must be compliant to acceptable laws of the European Union.
+ The server must be actively maintained.
+ The server must be stable and in production.
+ The maintainer must have joined our [official channel](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com)

### Reporting servers
When there is a problem with stability or uptime please report that in our channel [#matrixservers:novaim.com](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com) where the core of the community is. One of the moderators will pick this up soon as possible and checks out what's currently going on. Within this channel you can also find your server maintainer because he or she must be a part of our channel in-order to be listed. Which makes this channel the best place for support regarding matrix servers, listings and getting in touch with your maintainer or others.

However if you wish to report a server more anonymously you can always contact [Atreatis](https://matrix.to/#/@atreatis:novaim.com) directly through Matrix and the report shall be forwarded anonymously. And shall be processed like a normal report unless there is proven that there is a security breach within the server and shall acted directly upon when accurate evidence has been provided. When such a claim has been faked your future reports shall no longer be processed regarding of nature.

Our website holds no guarantee of uptime, maintenance or reliability of the maintainer we only list servers and put them inside a curated list. Once there are major issues going on please wait a couple of hours (up till 48 hours) before taking action. We handle a policy of a maximum down time of 48 hours before delisting the server from our curated list.
