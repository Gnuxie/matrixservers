## About matrix servers
When I joined the Matrix network I could not find a reliable resource for public matrix servers. Which was quite a bummer for me since I did not wanted to start my own server right away. From blogs and articles that I have seen online is that Matrix has done their privacy the right way. Thankfully those blog articles have triggered me on starting of my own matrix server called Nova IM which can be found in [our list](/servers) of public matrix servers.

As of the first moment I joined the network from my own server the first thing was a warm welcome when joining [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org). And started off chatting right away and totally did not feel alone on the network right away. When I started searching for accessible lists for matrix servers I considered starting off my own list and help with decentralization.

### How can I get my server added?  
Your server can be added through our official Github [repository](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers) by creating a new issue from the issue template. When your issue has been created your information will be added as soon as possible towards our list as long it falls within our policy. Or contacting through the official channel of [matrixservers.net](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com) and contact Atreatis for more information on adding your sever.  

### Server listings on our site  
By having your server added and displayed on our website we prefer you as a maintainer to follow the matrix.org [code of conduct](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/code_of_conduct.html). Whenever you disagree with the code of conduct from matrix.org you can still apply having your server added by joining our official room [matrixservers.net](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com) and explain the nature of your server. The decision on either rejecting or accepting a server will be judged on the information that you provide. We still hold the right on rejecting, accepting and withdrawing your listing.  

- The server must be actively maintained.
- The server must be stable and in production.  
- Create an issue with the [Add server](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers/issues/new?assignees=Atreatis&labels=&template=add-server.md&title=%5BADD%5D) issue template.  

### Server reliability & matrixservers.net  
Server listings on this website are added by our own judgement and will be processed like any other server. Under the condition that the responsibility remains at the maintainer of the corresponding server. The maintainer should ensure reliability for uptime and the integrity of the community that's using the server at all times. Whenever there is a serious issue you can submit an issue on our repository in order to have it checked out on what's going on.  

Personally I hold no responsibility over the servers that are listed on matrixservers.net. When there are network or stability issues of any server within the list you can report them through our official repository. We will have verify the information with included information and try to judge on our own. When you join a server within the network it will be fully under your responsibility and judgement with common sense. Since we only list and show servers that are publicly available in in a random order.  

### Want to get in touch?
Personally I do not give email support for matrixservers.net but we do offer support through [Github](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers) and directly through our official [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com). And everyone is invited to join in and have a chat within our channel. We do offer semi off-topic chats and not as heavily moderated channel like others within the network. As long the conversations are friendly and civil you won't get warned or kicked from the channel.

Currently our website repository is private, we do accept help for building our website to something more awesome. When you want to offer your help feel free to get in touch with me through our [matrix servers](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com). Also our website will get pushed towards the public repository soon or later when I feel more confident about the source code.
