### Ready to join the federation?
These servers are maintained by the community and are ran by volunteers that are part of the matrix.org network. Connecting or joining to any of these public matrix servers hold no guarantee for uptime, maintenance or reliability. More information can be found in our [about us](https://matrixservers.net/about/) which also describes our requirements for servers, moderation and processing. Always make sure to create backups of your recovery keys and have at least a recovery method enabled through email.  

### Featured server of the day
Featured servers of the day are randomly chosen after 24 hours and hold no additional value apart from being within the spotlights. However you can always check them out and join their support channel and congratulate them and say hello.
