## About us
When I joined the Matrix network I could not find a reliable resource for public matrix servers. Which was quite a bummer for me since I did not wanted to start my own server right away. From blogs and articles that I have seen online is that Matrix has done their privacy the right way. Thankfully those blog articles have triggered me on starting of my own matrix server called Nova IM which can be found in [our list](/servers) of public matrix servers.

As of the first moment I joined the network from my own server the first thing was a warm welcome when joining [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org). And started off chatting right away and totally did not feel alone on the network right away. When I started searching for accessible lists for matrix servers I considered starting off my own list and help with decentralization.

## Want to get in touch?
Personally I do not give email support for matrixservers.net but we do offer support through [Github](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers) and directly through our official [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com). And everyone is invited to join in and have a chat within our channel. We do offer semi off-topic chats and not as heavily moderated channel like others within the network. As long the conversations are friendly and civil you won't get warned or kicked from the channel.

## Want to help matrix servers?
Currently our website repository is private, we do accept help for building our website to something more awesome. When you want to offer your help feel free to get in touch with me through our [matrix servers](https://matrix.to/#/#matrixservers:novaim.com). Also our website will get pushed towards the public repository soon or later when I feel more confident about the source code.
